## js-dom: JS DOM(Document Object Model)
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model (DOM) of the page. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. 

 This file shows different methods to manipulate the DOM like:
- Selecting elements using various selectors (getElementById, getElementsByName, getElementsByTagName, getElementsByClassName, querySelector, and querySelectorAll )
- Creating and appending new elements (createElement)
- Modifying element attributes and styles (innerHTMl, textContent, getAttribute, setAttribute, hasAttribute ,window.getComputedStyle etc)
- Inserting and removing nodes (insertBefore , appendChild ,removeChild etc)
- working with classList
